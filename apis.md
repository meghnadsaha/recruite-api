### Conclusion:
These APIs should be able to handle the main functionalities of your staffing and recruitment platform for all stakeholders. You'll need to ensure proper validation, error handling, and authorization for each API endpoint, depending on the user roles and permissions. You can use **Spring Security** for role-based access control, and tools like **Swagger** for API documentation.




To start writing the API for your recruitment platform, the focus should generally be on **Candidate Portal**, as this is typically the core functionality of your platform, where users (candidates) interact with the system first. After that, you can progressively implement APIs for Vendor Portal, Client Portal, and Admin Portal.

Here’s a recommended order to start writing the APIs:

### 1. **Candidate Portal**
- **Job Searching and Application Submission**: This is the primary action for candidates in the system.
   - `GET /api/candidate/jobs`: Start by implementing job search APIs. This will fetch all active jobs based on search filters like keyword, location, and job type.
   - `POST /api/candidate/apply/{jobId}`: Implement the job application submission endpoint where candidates can apply to the jobs.

- **Resume Management**:
   - `POST /api/candidate/resume/upload`: Allow candidates to upload their resumes.
   - `GET /api/candidate/resume/{candidateId}`: Allow candidates to retrieve their uploaded resumes.

- **Candidate Profile Management**:
   - `GET /api/candidate/profile/{candidateId}`: Implement a feature to retrieve the candidate's profile.
   - `PUT /api/candidate/profile/{candidateId}`: Allow candidates to update their profile information (name, contact info, work experience, etc.).

### 2. **Vendor Portal**
- **Job Listings and Resume Sourcing**:
   - `GET /api/vendor/job-listings`: Vendors should be able to view all available job listings.
   - `POST /api/vendor/resume/upload`: Vendors can upload resumes for candidates.

- **Job Posting and Sourcing**:
   - `POST /api/vendor/job-posting`: Allow vendors to post jobs on behalf of clients.
   - `POST /api/vendor/submit-resume/{jobId}`: Allow vendors to submit resumes to a job opening.

### 3. **Client Portal**
- **Job Posting and Tracking**:
   - `POST /api/client/job-posting`: Clients should be able to post job openings.
   - `GET /api/client/job-applications/{jobId}`: Clients need to retrieve applications for a particular job posting.

- **Candidate Progress Tracking**:
   - `GET /api/client/candidate-status/{candidateId}/{jobId}`: Clients need to track the current status of a candidate’s application for a specific job.
   - `PUT /api/client/update-candidate-status/{candidateId}/{jobId}`: Allow clients to update candidate application status (Interview Scheduled, Offer Extended, etc.).

### 4. **Admin Portal**
- **User Management and Role Assignment**:
   - `GET /api/admin/users`: Admin should be able to manage users and their roles.
   - `POST /api/admin/user`: Create users like Admin, Recruiter, Candidate.
   - `PUT /api/admin/user/{userId}`: Admin should be able to update user information and roles.

- **Job Postings Management**:
   - `GET /api/admin/job-postings`: Admin should retrieve all job postings.
   - `PUT /api/admin/job-posting/{jobId}`: Admin should have the ability to edit job postings.

### 5. **General API Features**
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - `POST /api/auth/login`: Implement user login for all portals (Candidate, Vendor, Client, Admin).
   - `POST /api/auth/register`: Allow candidates to register and create accounts.
   - `POST /api/auth/logout`: Implement the logout functionality.

- **Workflow Automation**:
   - `POST /api/admin/workflow/automate`: Implement workflow automation rules to streamline recruitment processes (like sending emails or scheduling interviews).

- **Assessment and Interview Management**:
   - `POST /api/admin/assessment/create`: Admin can create assessments for candidates.
   - `POST /api/candidate/interview/{candidateId}`: Schedule an interview for a candidate.

- **Offer Letter Generation**:
   - `POST /api/admin/offer/{candidateId}/{jobId}`: Create and send offer letters to candidates.

### Why Start with Candidate Portal APIs?
- **Core user interaction**: Candidates are the primary users of the platform, so their ability to search for jobs, apply for them, and manage their resumes and profiles forms the core feature of your application.
- **Dependency for other portals**: The Vendor and Client portals largely depend on candidate applications and job listings, so having the Candidate Portal working first helps form a foundation for the other portals.

By implementing the Candidate Portal APIs first, you ensure the basic functionality is in place, making it easier to build upon this foundation for the other stakeholders (Vendors, Clients, and Admin). Once the Candidate Portal is done, you can shift to APIs for Vendor, Client, and Admin functionalities, respectively.
